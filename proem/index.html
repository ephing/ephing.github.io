                After years of seeing all of my closest friends manage their own blogs (see: 
                <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/">1</a>, <a href="https://jameshurd.net/">2</a>,
                <a href="https://garrettmills.dev/">3</a>), I finally found it within
                myself to take a stab at creating my own. I intend to write out my thoughts on any
                amusement, obsession, lust, or other passion that possesses my mind and yearns to escape.

                I fancy a lot of different things, but I think most of what I'll write about here
                will be about movies/tv, anime/manga, books, or, from time to time, some strange deep-cut
                math thing I had rattling around in my head. I'm down bad for any good high fantasy series,
                and also any <i>bad</i> high fantasy series, but I also enjoy science fiction and sometimes
                historical fiction. I also really enjoy board games and card games, mostly for the social
                aspect.

                I'm not a lot of places online. This website and anything linked here are the only
                digital proof that I am a real boy.
