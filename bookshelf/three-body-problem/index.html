                    For the majority of people, what they love exists only in the imagination.
                    The object of their love is not the man or woman of reality, but what he
                    or she is like in their imagination. The person in reality is just a template
                    used for the creation of this dream lover. Eventually, they find out the
                    differences between their dream lover and the template. If they can get used
                    to those differences, then they can be together.
